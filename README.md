## Structure overview

This is an outline repository fulfilling structure requirements for a course. The following files and directories are
required:

- **images** - directory with images used by course; NOTE that the final path differs from the path within the course
  repository as follows:
  `/images/<path> -> /api/content/courseImages/<course-id>/<path>`
- **topics** - directory with topics
- **advanced.json** - course level description
- **beginner.json** - course level description
- **index.json** - course description
- **intermediate.json** - course level description

The branch names correspond to the deployment environments as it is described in the section above.

### Courses

Courses are the top-level entity in the ScalaZONE material structure. Their structure is stored in the root directory of
the course repository. The [index.json](/index.json) file stores a list with all available courses. For each course
there is a directory named after the course id that contains the course structure. Basic course data is stored in
the `index.json` file in this directory. Here is the `Course` JSON type structure:

| Field name         | Type             | Description                                                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`             | String           | Name of the course that is visible on the website                                                           |
| `courseLevelTypes` | List of strings  | List of available levels of the course. Levels are described in the next paragraph                          |
| `image`            | String, Optional | Path to the image for the course; it has to refer to an image by the path mapped to content root repository |
| `video`            | String, Optional | Video link that is displayed on the course overview page                                                    |
| `description`      | String           | Description of the course                                                                                   |
| `language`         | String           | Language in which the course content is written, e.g. English                                               |
| `scope`            | List of strings  | Scope of the course; these are presented in the bullet list on the course overview page                     |
| `sponsoredBy`      | String, Optional | Id of company sponsoring the course                                                                         |

### Course Levels

Course levels are parts of the course that are suited for users starting with different ability levels. There are three levels that are possible to add to a course:
 - Beginner
 - Intermediate
 - Advanced

To add a level to a course, it must be present in the `courseLevelTypes` field in the course's index.json file. Level can be configured using `<level>.json` file in the course directory, where `<level>` is either `beginner`, `intermediate` or `advanced`. Here is the `Level` JSON structure:

| Field name    | Type                         | Description                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | String                       | Name of the course level that is visible on the level page |
| `description` | String                       | Description of the course level                            |
| `ranges`      | List of `TopicRange` objects | Defines lessons and topics that are present in the level   |

And the `TopicRange` type has the following structure in json:

| Field name    | Type   | Description                                               |
|---------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `topicId`     | String | Id of the topic                                           |
| `lessonStart` | String | Id of the first lesson of the topic included in the level |
| `lessonEnd`   | String | Id of the last lesson of the topic included in the topic  |

Topic ranges define what topics and lessons are present in a course level. By specifying this, we are able to use only a slice of a topic for a particular course level. These slices may, however, overlap between level, so that a particular lesson may appear in more than one level.

### Topics

Topics are ordered collections of lessons. Their index is stored in the [topics/index.json](topics/index.json) file. The
structure of a single topic is defined in the `index.json` file inside the specific directory named after the topic in
the `topics` directory. This `index.json` file has following JSON structure:

| Field name    | Type             | Description                                      |
|---------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | String           | Name of the topic that is visible on the website |
| `order`       | Int              | Order number; allows organizing topics           |
| `description` | String           | Description of the topic                         |
| `lessons`     | List of `Lesson` | Lessons that this topic consists of              |

### Lessons

| Field name      | Type                          | Description                                                                                                      |

| `description`   | String                        | Description of the lesson (about 1-3 sentences); it is visible in the Google search results                      |
| `authorIds`     | List of strings, Optional     | Ids of the lesson's authors                                                                                      |
| `video`         | Lesson video, Optional        | URL to an embeddable lesson video                                                                                |

| `prerequisites` | List of `LessonPrerequisites` | Ids of lessons that are prerequisites of this lesson                                                             |
| `comingSoon`    | Boolean, Optional             | Marks lesson as coming soon; `false` by default; **NOTE: (possibly empty) {id}.md file is required in any case** |

The `LessonPrerequisite` JSON type structure:

| Field name | Type             | Description                                                                                                                     |

A lesson's content files are present in the topics directory, within a directory specific to the lesson's topic. The
content file must be named after the lesson id and have a `.md` file extension. This file defines the text and questions
that user sees after entering the lesson page. You can use most of the markdown features inside of it, including tables,
images and a special syntax for videos.

#### Video syntax
To embed a video inside a lesson you can use the following syntax:

```md
[![alt text](alt image link)](embeddable video link)
```

#### Questions section

The first part of every lesson's markdown file is the lesson's content: the text that is visible on the lessons page, and is meant to explain a concept specific to this lesson. After this first part, it is possible to include questions testing the user's understanding at the end of the lesson. To do so, first introduce the questions section separator: `?---?` and write your questions after it. At this moment there are two types of questions: _single answer questions_ (using radio buttons) and _multiple answer questions_ (using checkboxes). Every question begins with a single-hash markdown header, for example:

```md
# What is 1+1?
```

It is possible to include code blocks, tables and other markdown elements that are not children of the header element, but they must follow the header element.

After the question text, you must provide the question's answer choices, by specifying an unordered markdown list. It can be defined either using dashes (`-`) or asterisks (`*`). However, the character you choose determines the type of the question. Dashes are used for single answer questions and asterisks for multiple answer questions. To indicate whether the answer is correct you should use the markdown checkboxes that follow the list character. Two examples below exemplify this behaviour:

Single answer question:
~~~md
# What is the result of expression below?

```
2+2
```

 - [ ] 3
 - [X] 4
 - [ ] 7
~~~

Multiple answer question:
~~~md
# What is the result of expression below?

```
2+2
```

 * [ ] 3
 * [X] 4
 * [ ] 7
 * [X] Four
~~~

To summarize, let's look on a sample lesson containing some mock content and two questions:

~~~md
# Arithmetic

## Addition

To add two numbers ...

## Subtraction

...

?---?

# What is the result of the expression, `2+2`?

 - [ ] 3
 - [X] 4
 - [ ] 7

# What is the result of expression below?

```
2+2
```

 * [ ] 3
 * [X] 4
 * [ ] 7
 * [X] Four

~~~
